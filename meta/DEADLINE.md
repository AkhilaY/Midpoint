## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

This app is a represention of the game "pong", commonly known as an arcade game.
It operates like a normal online ping pong game where the user plays against the computer.
The score updates everytime the user or computer misses the ball.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

At first, I was working with multiple classes to deal with the various components (the paddle, ball...etc.), but
after analyzing each class, I realized that I could consolidate these classes into one. This decreased the lag I was initially
facing by a significant amount.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would definitely work on planning it out a lot better. As mentioned above, I could have easily avoided writing
multiple classes, had I planned out the logistics much better.
